.IX Title "FERM 1"
.TH FERM 1 "2003-05-07" "ferm 1.1" "FIREWALL RULES MADE EASY"
.SH "NAME"
\&\fBferm\fR \- a firewall rule parser for linux
.SH "SYNOPSYS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSYS"
\&\fBferm\fR \fIoptions\fR \fIinputfiles\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBferm\fR compiles ready to go firewall-rules from a structured
rule\-setup. These rules will be executed by the preferred kernel
interface, such as \fIipchains\fR\|(8) and \fIiptables\fR\|(8).
.PP
Besides just executing all rules in one command, the obvious gain
is the possibility to provide a structured description of a
firewall. No need anymore for tedious typing all firewalls into
custom scripts, you can now write logically and coherent rules
using a C\-style nesting structure, and let \fBferm\fR create all
rules for you.
.PP
\&\fBferm\fR will also aid in modularizing firewalls, because it
creates the possibility to split up the firewall into several
different files, which can be reloaded at will, so you can
dynamically adjust your rules.
.PP
\&\fBferm\fR, pronounced \*(L"firm\*(R", stands for \*(L"For Easy Rule Making\*(R".
.SH "STRUCTURE OF A FIREWALL FILE"
.IX Header "STRUCTURE OF A FIREWALL FILE"
The structure of a proper firewall file looks like  simplified
C\-code. Only a few syntactic characters are used in ferm\-
configuration files. Besides these special caracters, ferm
uses 'keys' and 'values', think of them as options and
parameters, or as variables and values, whatever.
.PP
With these words, you define the characteristics of your firewall.
Every firewall consists of two things: First, look if network
traffic matches certain conditions, and second, what to do
with that traffic.
.PP
You may specify conditions that are valid for the kernel
interface program you are using, probably \fIiptables\fR\|(8). For
instance, in iptables, when you are trying to match tcp
packets, you would say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    iptables --protocol tcp
.Ve
.PP
In ferm, this will become:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    protocol tcp;
.Ve
.PP
Just typing this in ferm doesn't do anything, you need to tell
ferm (actually, you need to tell \fIiptables\fR\|(8) and the kernel) what
to do with any traffic that matches this condition:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    iptables --protocol tcp -j ACCEPT
.Ve
.PP
Or, translated to \fBferm\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    protocol tcp accept;
.Ve
.PP
Noticed the \fB;\fR character? We're getting to that now, because there
are some special characters in \fBferm\fR that make life easy.
.PP
Here's a list of the special characters:
.IP "\fB;\fR" 8
.IX Item ";"
The effectuation character. This character defines the end of
a rule. Anything defined before this character will be put
into one or more rules.
.Sp
This character *makes* the rule. It gathers all the information, all
parameters and targets, special things or whatever, that currently
is 'valid', and tries to make a decent rule out of it. \fBferm\fR will
do nothing without this character!
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    proto tcp ACCEPT;
.Ve
.Sp
THis example shows a single rule, defined by two keys and one
value.
.IP "\fB{}\fR" 8
.IX Item "{}"
The nesting symbol defines a 'block' of rules.
.Sp
Anything defined before this block will
still be available within all rules inside this block. You can
nest blocks in blocks as far as you like. For every rule
defined in this block the values defined before this block
will apply. Usually you would define an often used parameter
as the protocol in front of this block, and anything special
inside it.
.Sp
You can put as many rules (using the <;> character) as you 
like insode this block. but there should always be one or
more, although you will get away with none. Not very
usefull except for when you frequently edit you config
file, and might want to leave a chain empty.
.Sp
Since the nesting block is left associative, it cannot be bound
to keys defined after the block.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    chain INPUT proto tcp {
\&        syn DENY;
\&        ACCEPT;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
This block shows two rules inside a block, which will both be merged
with anything in front of it, so you will get two rules:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -y -j DENY
\&    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j ACCEPT
.Ve
.IP "\fB%\fR" 8
.IX Item "%"
Further more, ferm now supports variables, so you can define your
favorite targets, interfaces etc. before you use them. It works
like this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    set IF eth0
\&    set %IF ACCEPT
\&    set TARGET %IF
.Ve
.Sp
will result in this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    %IF = eth0
\&    %eth0 = ACCEPT
\&    %TARGET = eth0
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to put multiple arguments into a variable, you should do
it like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    %IFS = "eth0,eth1,ppp0"
.Ve
.Sp
This way, ferm will recognize it being a list of values, and split it
whenever needed. If you use spaces, ferm won't recognize it and think
its just a value with spaces. The comma tells ferm to split it up
when needed.
.IP "\fB()\fR" 8
.IX Item "()"
The array symbol. Using the parentheses, you can define
a 'list' of values that should be applied for the key to the
left of it.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    proto ( tcp udp icmp )
.Ve
.Sp
this will result in three rules:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    ... -p tcp ...
\&    ... -p udp ...
\&    ... -p icmp ...
.Ve
.Sp
Only values can be 'listed', so you cannot do something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    proto tcp ( ACCEPT LOG );
.Ve
.Sp
but you can do this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    chain (INPUT OUTPUT FORWARD) proto (icmp,udp,tcp) DENY;
.Ve
.Sp
(which will result in nine rules!)
.Sp
Values can be separated either by spaces or commas. The
array symbol is both left\- and right\-associative, in contrast
with the nesting block, which is left-associative only.
.ie n .IP """ # """ 8
.el .IP "\f(CW # \fR" 8
.IX Item " # "
The comment symbol. Anything that follows this symbol up to
the end of line is ignored.
.PP
These symbols glue all the keywords into a structure, which
allows you to specify some keys only a few times, and let them
apply to any key/value pairs defined within an entire block, for
instance:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    proto tcp {
\&        dport 22 ACCEPT;
\&        syn DPORT 0:1023 DENY;
\&        }
\&    ACCEPT;
.Ve
.PP
Now here, the 'proto tcp' is valid within the block, but not anymore
after is, resulting in:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    ... -p tcp --dport 22 -j accept
\&    ... -p tcp -y --dport 0:1023 -j deny
\&    ... -j accept # note '-p tcp' is not in here!
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBSome important notes:\fR
.PP
\&\- Ferm inserts the rules 'chronologically', so the first rule will
be inserted before the second one.
.PP
\&\- Anything defined within a block is no longer valid when that block
ends.
.PP
\&\- Everything defined within the current block that is 'effectuated',
will be no longer defined immediately after that point.
.PP
\&\- Everything defined before a block is undefined when this block 
closes.
.PP
If you do not understand this, don't worry, it alle becomes clear
by itself.
.PP
Two types of keys exist:
.Sh "Firewall keys"
.IX Subsection "Firewall keys"
.RS 8
Firewall keys define a set of firewall packet matching
criteria that is supported by the kernel backend. They
look like 'name value' pairs or like 'switch'. For
instance:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    proto tcp
.Ve
.Sp
or:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    syn
.Ve
.Sp
A 'name value' pair lets you fill in a value for a certain
condition you would like to match packets against, switches
are like on/off light switches on the wall, if you specify
a switch, you turn paket matching for whatever the switch
stands, on. In the latter example, you turn SYN-packet
matching on for this rule.
.Sp
Both types can optionally be preceded by a \fB!\fR. This will
be handled that you don't want something to be matching
it:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    !syn
.Ve
.Sp
or:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ! syn
.Ve
.Sp
Means you want packets which *don't* have the syn-flag set to
be matched. Or even:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    proto ! tcp
.Ve
.Sp
Means you want to match *anything but* packets from the tcp
protocol.
.Sp
Read \fIiptables\fR\|(8) or \fIipchains\fR\|(8) to see where the \fB!\fR can be used.
.Sh "Option keys"
.IX Subsection "Option keys"
Using \fBoption\fR keys alter the behaviour of \fBferm\fR; they
can be used to e.g. clear chains before use, or turn off certain
sanity checks.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  option verbose
.Ve
.Sp
This option makes \fBferm\fR show a lot of information about what
it is doing.
.RE
.PP
The syntax is very simple, let's start with a simple
example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    chain input {
\&        proto tcp ACCEPT;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This will add a rule to the predefined input chain, matching
and accepting all tcp packets.  Ok, let's make it more complicated:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    chain (input,output) {
\&        proto (udp,tcp) ACCEPT;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
This will insert 4 rules, namely 2 in chain input, and 2 in
chain output, matching and accepting both udp and tcp packets.
Normally you would type this for \fIipchains\fR\|(8):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   ipchains -A input -p tcp ACCEPT
\&   ipchains -A output -p tcp ACCEPT
\&   ipchains -A input -p udp ACCEPT
\&   ipchains -A output -p udp ACCEPT
.Ve
.PP
Note how much less typing we need to do? :\-)
.PP
Basically, this is all there is to it, although you can
make it quite more complex. Something to look at:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   chain input policy ACCEPT {
\&       destination 10/8 port ! ftp goto mychain sport :1023 tos 4 settos 8 mark 2;
\&       destination 10/8 port ftp DENY;
\&   }
.Ve
.PP
My point here is, that *you* need to make nice rules, keep
them readable to you and others, and not make it into a mess.
.PP
It would aid the reader if the resulting firewall rules were placed here for
reference. Also, you could include the nested version with better
readability.
.PP
Try using comments to show what you are doing:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # this line enables transparent http-proxying for the internal network:
\&    proto tcp if eth0 daddr ! 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
\&        dport http REDIRECT 3128;
.Ve
.PP
You will be thankfull for it later!
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    chain input policy ACCEPT {
\&        interface (eth0,ppp0) {
\&            # deny access to notorius hackers, return here if
\&            # no match was found to resume normal firewalling
\&            goto badguys;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&            protocol tcp goto fw_tcp;
\&            protocol udp goto fw_udp;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The more you nest, the better it looks. Make sure the order you
specify is correct, you would not want to do this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    chain forward {
\&        proto ! udp DENY;
\&        proto tcp dport ftp ACCEPT;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
because the second rule will never match. Best way is to specify
first everyting that is allowed, and then deny everything else.
Look at the examples for more good snapshots. Most people do
something like this:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    proto tcp {
\&        dport (
\&            ssh http ftp
\&        ) ACCEPT;
\&        dport 1024:65535 ! syn ACCEPT;
\&        DROP;
\&    }
.Ve
.Sh "keywords"
.IX Subsection "keywords"
To make life easy, \fBferm\fR allows you to use shorthands for
most keywords. A list of shorthand notations is available at the end
of this section.
.PP
What kind of value you provide for a keyword depends on the 
keyword entirely, e.g. 'protocol' expects 'tcp', 'udp' or 'icmp',
\&'log\-prefix' expects a value like '\*(L"whoops, someone rang the
doorbell\*(R"' and 'destination\-port' can accept values like 'http',
\&'80' or '0:1023'. Take a look at the kernel backend program
manual for possible values and how they look like.
.PP
Note you may put a value in single quotes or double quotes,
if this may be required because a value contains spaces:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    log-prefix "Dropped tcp package: "
.Ve
.PP
Please keep in mind that some characters have special meaning,
so it might be wise to refrain from using any other character
then letters and digits and spaces unless you need them and
know what you're doing. Take a look at \fB\s-1VARIABLES\s0\fR and
\&\fB\s-1SHELL\s0 \s-1ESCAPES\s0\fR for more information about that.
.IP "\fBchain [chain\-name]\fR" 8
.IX Item "chain [chain-name]"
Specifies a chain that this rule will be inserted to. this
is a required key for any rule. Chains can be
built in, like \f(CW\*(C`input\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`output\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR, or user-defined
chains.
.IP "\fBinterface [interface\-name]\fR" 8
.IX Item "interface [interface-name]"
Define the interface name, your outside network card, like eth0,
or dialup like ppp1, or whatever device you want to match for
passing packets. It is equivalent to the \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR switch in
\&\fIipchains\fR\|(8) and \fIiptables\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fBouterface [interface\-name]\fR" 8
.IX Item "outerface [interface-name]"
Same as interface, only for matching the outgoing interface
for a packet, as in \fIiptables\fR\|(8). \fIipchains\fR\|(8) hasn't got this
parameter.
.IP "\fBprotocol [protocol\-name|protocol\-number]\fR" 8
.IX Item "protocol [protocol-name|protocol-number]"
Currently supported by the kernel are tcp, udp and icmp, or
their respective numbers.
.IP "\fBport [port\-spec]\fR" 8
.IX Item "port [port-spec]"
Specify a port number, name or range
.IP "\fBaddr [address\-spec]\fR" 8
.IX Item "addr [address-spec]"
Specify a network address, a hostname or ip\-number.
.IP "\fBsource|destination\fR" 8
.IX Item "source|destination"
Specify that the values provided for \fBport\fR and \fBaddr\fR
above should be either \fBsource\fR or <destination> ports
and addresses. This works like a toggle, which can be left on
for the entire configuration file. So, if you say \fBsource\fR once,
all occurences of \fBport\fR will be \fBsource port\fR's, as well as for
addresses.
.IP "\fBsaddr|daddr [address\-spec]\fR" 8
.IX Item "saddr|daddr [address-spec]"
Specify an address specifically for the \fBsource\fR or \fBdestination\fR
side, read it as a shorthand for \fBsource address\fR and \fBdestination
address\fR, although it does not 'toggle' the \fBsource|destination\fR
state, which is remembered.
.IP "\fBsport|dport [port\-spec]\fR" 8
.IX Item "sport|dport [port-spec]"
Specify a port number, name or range for the \fBsource\fR or \fBdestination\fR
side, read it as a shorthand for \fBsource port\fR and \fBdestination
port\fR>, although it does not 'toggle' the \fBsource|destination\fR
state, which is remembered. Ports can be specified for tcp and udp,
as well as icmp, only in that case it means 'icmp\-type' and only
works when you specify the type numerically.
.Sp
Note that you need to specify a protocol, before you can use
ports, that is because not all protocols support the ideas
of ports.
.Sp
Here are some examples of valid addresses:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    192.168/8 (identical to the next one:)
\&    192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
\&    my.domain.com
.Ve
.Sp
And some examples of valid ports/ranges:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    80
\&    http
\&    ssh:http
\&    0:1023        which is equivalent to     :1023
\&    1023:65535    which is equivalent to     1023:65535
.Ve
.IP "\fBicmptype [type]\fR" 8
.IX Item "icmptype [type]"
To specify an icmp message type. Can be numbers, but refer
to the manual of the kernel program to retreive a list,
for ipchains use "ipchains \f(CW\*(C`\-h\*(C'\fR icmp". Examples: ping, pong.
.IP "\fBtos [value]\fR" 8
.IX Item "tos [value]"
Matches a packet on the specified TOS\-value. See settos for
values.
.IP "\fBsettos [value]\fR" 8
.IX Item "settos [value]"
Set the tcp package Type Of Service bit to this value.
This will be used by whatever traffic scheduler is willing to,
mostly your own linux\-machine, but maybe more. The original
tos-bits are blanked and overwritten by this value. Possible
values are (look in the shorthands for more, and easier
values) :
.Sp
02 04 08 10
.IP "\fBsetftos [value]\fR" 8
.IX Item "setftos [value]"
Set \s-1TOS\s0 field in packet header to value. This value can be
in decimal (ex: 32) or in hex (ex: 0x20)
.IP "\fBmark [value]\fR" 8
.IX Item "mark [value]"
matches packets based on their mark-value
.IP "\fBsetmark [value]\fR" 8
.IX Item "setmark [value]"
Sets the mark-value for a packet, use with the \s-1MARK\s0 target in iptables
.IP "\fBsyn\fR" 8
.IX Item "syn"
Specify that the \s-1SYN\s0 flag in a tcp package should be matched,
which are used to build new tcp connections. You can identify
incoming connections with this, and decide wether you want
to allow it or not. Packets that do not have this flag are
probably from an already established connection, so it's
considered reasonably safe to let these through.
.IP "\fBfragment\fR" 8
.IX Item "fragment"
Specify that only fragmented \s-1IP\s0 packets should be matched.
When packets are larger that the maximum packet size your
system can handle (called Maximum Transmission Unit or \s-1MTU\s0)
they will be chopped into bits and sent one by one as single
packets. See \fIifconfig\fR\|(8) if you want to find the \s-1MTU\s0 for
your system (the default is usually 1500 bytes).
.Sp
Fragments are frequently used in \s-1DOS\s0 attacks, because there
is no way of finding out the origin of a fragment packet.
.IP "\fBpolicy [policy]\fR" 8
.IX Item "policy [policy]"
Specifies the default policy for the current chain. Can be
either of the standard actions (\s-1ACCEPT\s0, \s-1DENY\s0, \s-1REJECT\s0, \s-1MASQ\s0
and \s-1REDIRECT\s0). A packet that matches no rules will be treated
as specified by the policy. You can't specify chain names
here. Only the predefined (built\-in) chains have policies.
.Sp
To avoid ambiguity, always specify the policies of all
predefined chains explicitly.
.IP "\fBlog\fR" 8
.IX Item "log"
Log all packets that match this rule in the kernel log. Be
carefull with log flooding. Note the difference with \fB\s-1LOG\s0\fR
in iptables! See \fB\s-1LOG\s0\fR as well. In iptables, this makes a
copy of the current rule, and inserts it with the \s-1LOG\s0 target
instead of any other specified target. 
.Sp
See also \fBlog\-[level|prefix|tcp\-sequence|tcp\-options|ip\-options]\fR
.IP "\fBgoto [chain]\fR" 8
.IX Item "goto [chain]"
Specify that matching packets should jump to this chain, only user
defined chains are valid jump targets.
.IP "\fBreverse\fR" 8
.IX Item "reverse"
Instructs the kernel to use this rule twice, the second time with
source and destination swapped. Unfortunately, this doesn't work
with iptables.
.IP "\fB\s-1LOG\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "LOG"
Identical to the '\s-1LOG\s0' target in iptables, logs any packet that
matches, but doesn't do anything else to it. Only valid for
iptables, otherwise use 'log'. See \fBlog\fR and also
\&\fBlog\-[level|prefix|tcp\-sequence|tcp\-options|ip\-options]\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1ACCEPT\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "ACCEPT"
Accepts matching packets.
.IP "\fB\s-1REJECT\s0\fR" 8

port-range for iptables. Specify as \*(L"123\*(R", \*(L"123\-456\*(R" or \*(L"123:456\*(R".
The port range parameter specifies what local ports masqueraded
connections should originate from. Note you need to specify the
\&'to' word here.
.IP "\fB\s-1RETURN\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "RETURN"
Returns to the parent chain where the current chain was called
if the packet matches.

Allows transparent proxying when rule matches, the port that is
redirected to must immediately follow this keyword. The target
may also be an IP-number in case you are using \fIiptables\fR\|(8), so
something like \*(L"\s-1REDIRECT\s0 192.168.0.5:21\*(R" is valid there.
.IP "\fBSNAT|DNAT to [ip\-address|ip\-range|ip\-port\-range]\fR" 8
.IX Item "SNAT|DNAT to [ip-address|ip-range|ip-port-range]"
Allows source/destination address translation, only valid for

.IP "\fBset [name] [value]\fR" 8
.IX Item "set [name] [value]"
Set variable \*(L"name\*(R" to value \*(L"value\*(R", you can dereference the variables
by \*(L"%name\*(R". You may also put variables within \fBset\fR statements.
.SH "VARIABLES"
.IX Header "VARIABLES"
ferm also supports internal variables. This may come in handy if you
wish to define often used parameters in advance, making the ferm
configuration files even more easy to understand. 
.PP
Setting variables is very easy with the \fBset\fR command. Here's some
examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    set EXTERAL_IP "111.22.33.44"
\&    set INTERNAL_IP '10.0.0.1'
.Ve
.PP
Both these statements set the variable to what is in between the quotes,
you may afterwards refer to them like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    chain input daddr ! %EXTERNAL_IP DROP;
.Ve
.PP
The value of the variable will then be inserted into the rule and
passed to the firewall program.
.PP
the \fBset\fR command can actally be abused even more, since the following
statements also work:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    set A "1"
\&    set B %A
\&    set %A "2"
.Ve
.PP
After these statements, variable \f(CW%A\fR yields value \*(L"1\*(R", variable \f(CW%B\fR holds 
the value \*(L"1\*(R", and the variable \f(CW%1\fR holds the value \*(L"1\*(R" also.
.PP
More importantly, these variables can be used to store arrays or lists
of values:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set DNSSERVERS "111.2.33.1,111.2.33.2"
.Ve
.PP
When this variable is inserted into a configuration file, the rule that
it applies to will automatically be split up into two different firewall
rules for each \s-1IP\s0 number given in the list.
.PP
Here's some even more complicated stuff that works:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    set INTERNALINTERFACES "eth0,eth1,eth2"
\&    set EXTERNALINTERFACES "ppp0,tunl0"
\&    set INTERFACES "%INTERNALINTERFACES,%EXTERNALINTERFACES,lo"
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: Beware of mixing '' string values within new string
values, because the trailing ' might be concatenated with
another one in the variable that you are including it. Take
a look at this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    set IF1 'eth0'
\&    set IF2 'eth1'
\&    set IFS '%IF1,%IF2'
.Ve
.PP
Variable \s-1IFS\s0 will now contain the value ''eth0','eth1'' and that is
probably not what you want. Better do this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    set OF1 "eth0"
\&    set OF2 "eth1"
\&    set OFS "%OF1,%OF2"
.Ve
.PP
Which will result in variable \s-1OFS\s0 holding the value \*(L"eth0,eth1\*(R",
which will be split up correctly, namely into \*(L"eth0\*(R" and \*(L"eth1\*(R".
.SH "SHELL ESCAPES"
.IX Header "SHELL ESCAPES"
Ferm supports shell escaping in two ways. First, you may insert a
shell escaped string into a \fBset\fR command, second, you may insert
a shell escaped string into any place of a value.
.PP
There is a fundamental difference in this. Ferm will handle shell
escapes itself when they are used in a \fBset\fR construction, so the
variable then contains the value that was returned from the shell
escape. You may later refer to this value again without the command
being executed again.
.PP
When you use a shell escaped string as a value without it being
in a \fBset\fR statement, the exact string is just copied in the
generated rule, and when parsing is finished, ferm will call
the shell with the entire rule, and thus the shell escaped string.
Only at this moment, the shell will execute the string and insert
the value back into the kernel interface program. Thus, ferm will
never see the real value of that.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    set DNSSERVERS `grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'`
\&    chain input proto tcp saddr %DNSSERVERS ACCEPT;
.Ve
.PP
This way, ferm will interpret the value for \s-1DSSERVERS\s0 itself, put
a separating comma between multiple values if needed, and store
this information in the variable \s-1DNSSERVERS\s0. The output will be
like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.0.1 -j ACCEPT
\&    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.0.2 -j ACCEPT
.Ve
.PP
Otherwise, when you include a shell escape as a regular value
in between other ferm\-statements:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    chain input proto tcp saddr `grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'` ACCEPT;
.Ve
.PP
The shell escape is not parsed directly, but passed along with the, e.g.
\&\fBiptables\fR command, and subsequently, the shell will insert whatever
that value may become itself:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp -d `grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'` -j ACCEPT
.Ve
.PP
Note that if the shell escape here yields more lines, something could
go wrong here easily. You are warned! Better not make ferm \s-1SUID\s0 too
I guess ;\-)
