Ferm for Debian
===============

There's an ifupdown pre-up hook defined for form.
If you place your rules in /etc/network/rules.ferm,
they will be loaded before any interface goes up.

Additionally, specifying "ferm-fast yes" in /etc/network/interfaces
for an interface makes ferm use the faster iptables-restore(8).
